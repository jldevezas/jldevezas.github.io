- A creative, anarcho-capitalist, `PhD in Computer Science` from Portugal.
- Specialist in `information retrieval` and `network science`.
- Enjoys `random walks`, `machine learning`, and `data science`.
- Mainly codes in `Python`, but also a master of `R`, and a lover of `Scala`.
- Believer in diversity and equality, but not fussy about it.
- `No-bullshit`, people-take-precedence policy, and an endless passion for questioning.
- Gets bored easily, works best when focused on a single, challenging goal.
- Disbeliever in multitasking, unless it's a computer doing it.
- Doesn't care about benefits, only money (`crypto` is fine).
- `Anti` compartmentalization, emotional intelligence, or `social convention`.
- Believes an individual should be `free to be` regardless of context.
- `Engineer`, `programmer`, `sysadmin` --- I get it done.
- And did I mention the `no-bullshit` policy?
